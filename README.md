# UMMBridge

Run [UnityModManager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM) mods under [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader).

## Overview

UMMBridge loads UMM inside MelonLoader, transparently bridging the two mod ecosystems. It intercepts `UnityModManager.modsPath`, redirecting to `UMMMods/`, then boots UMM and its UI alongside MelonLoader's plugin pipeline.

## Dual-Harmony Architecture

UMM ships **0Harmony 2.3.6** (with its own MonoMod) while MelonLoader uses **HarmonyX** (a different MonoMod). Two MonoMod runtimes cannot write JMP detours on the same method entry. UMMBridge resolves this by keeping every UMM **mod** patch on a single runtime — HarmonyX — including transpilers, which are converted at the boundary. The one exception is a method whose entry a UMM core patch already claimed natively: later mod patches (transpilers included) join that native table instead of getting a detour of their own.

### Three-layer resolution

| Layer | Trigger | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Cecil rewriting** | Assembly load (`LoadFrom` interception) | Renames `0Harmony`→`0Harmony_UMM`, rewrites `Patch()` calls to `ProxyPatch` (transpiler assemblies included) |
| **UpdateWrapper injection** | `CreateClassProcessor`/`PatchAll` path | IL injection at `PatchFunctions.UpdateWrapper()`: in bridge mode a mod patch job is routed to HarmonyX unless that method is already claimed natively |
| **Harmony.Patch() prefix** | Direct `Harmony.Patch()` calls | HarmonyX prefix on `0Harmony_UMM.Harmony.Patch()`: converts a mod transpiler to HarmonyX, keeps UMM's own core patches native, and joins the native patch table instead of adding a second detour |

### Patch routing

- **Transpilers (bridge enabled, default)** — `TranspilerBridge` converts `IEnumerable<CodeInstruction>` in both directions: the mod's transpiler still runs against 0Harmony_UMM's own `CodeInstruction` objects, while its patch is registered on **HarmonyX** together with every other patch for that method. Labels and operands are preserved; exception blocks are converted on a best-effort basis. If the method entry is *already* owned natively (a core patch got there first), the patch joins that native table instead — one detour either way.
- **Non-transpiler patches** — Cecil-rewritten via `ProxyPatch`, applied through **HarmonyX** on a free entry, or joined to the existing native table when the entry is already native.
- **Native runtime** — UMM's own core patches, methods already claimed natively by a core patch, or any patch when the bridge is disabled.
- **No migration** — there is no path that moves patches between the two runtimes. HarmonyX's `ManagedMethodPatcher.DetourTo()` re-applies its ILHook even after the method is unpatched, so a migration would leave that detour behind and stack a second JMP on the same prologue. The bridge picks a runtime per method up front instead.
- **Fallback** — If a transpiler cannot be wrapped (unsupported parameter, non-static method, generation failure), the reason is logged; the patch then joins the native table when 0Harmony_UMM already owns the entry, and is skipped with that reason when only HarmonyX owns it (writing a second detour is never an option).

### Configuration

Transpiler bridging is enabled by default. To restore the previous build-time routing, disable it with either:

- `UMMBridge.cfg` next to `UMMBridge.dll`, containing `TranspilerBridge=false`
- the environment variable `UMMBRIDGE_TRANSPILER_BRIDGE=0`

When disabled, assemblies containing transpilers keep their `Patch()` calls native and are handled by 0Harmony_UMM, exactly like earlier versions.

### Coexistence

The following table summarizes what happens when two patches target the same method:

| Scenario | Patch Type | Result |
|----------|------------|--------|
| UMM mod patch + MelonLoader mod patch (bridge on, free entry) | Any, incl. transpilers | ✅ **Works** — every mod patch lives on HarmonyX, so patches stack. |
| UMM mod patch + UMM mod patch (bridge on, free entry) | Any, incl. transpilers | ✅ **Works** — no second runtime, no load-order dependency. |
| UMM **core** patch first, then UMM mod patches (bridge on) | Any, incl. transpilers | ✅ **Works** — the core patch owns the entry natively, later mod patches join that native table; still one detour. |
| Native core patch + a patch written straight into HarmonyX (bridge bypassed) | Any | ⚠️ **One wins** — two detours on one prologue: whichever was written second tramples the other. |
| Bridge disabled: UMM transpiler + HarmonyX patch | Transpiler | ❌ **Never works** — the native transpiler cannot move to HarmonyX (previous behaviour). |

**Key limitation:**  
Two MonoMod runtimes (HarmonyX and 0Harmony_UMM) still **cannot** both write JMP detours on the same method. The bridge removes that conflict for **mods** by converting transpilers at the boundary and by routing each method to exactly one runtime: patches that arrive through the bridge join whichever runtime already owns the entry. The remaining one-wins case is a patch that reaches HarmonyX *outside* the bridge on a method a core patch already owns natively.

### Limitations

- **UMM core patches stay native** — A method already claimed by a native core patch cannot also receive a HarmonyX detour. Later mod patches join that native table (transpilers included) instead of getting a detour of their own; a patch whose transpiler cannot be wrapped is skipped with a logged reason when only HarmonyX owns the entry.
- **Bridge scope** — `TranspilerBridge` converts `CodeInstruction` streams (opcode, operand, labels, exception blocks). The transpiler still executes against 0Harmony_UMM objects by design; a transpiler whose signature cannot be bound is logged and handled by the same runtime rule: it joins the native table when 0Harmony_UMM already owns the entry, and is skipped with that reason when only HarmonyX owns it.
- **No perfect coexistence** — There is no way to make a HarmonyX‑based patch and a 0Harmony_UMM‑based patch both apply to the same method entry simultaneously. The design prioritizes stability over universal coexistence.

## Usage

1. Drop the compiled DLL into ADOFAI's `Plugins/` directory
2. Place UMM mods into `UMMMods/` (created automatically on first launch)
3. Open the UMM window and click **Mods Dir** at the top-right

## Build

```
dotnet build UMMBridge\UMMBridge.csproj -c Release
```

Or open `UMMBridge.slnx` in Visual Studio 2022. The `Deploy` configuration outputs directly to the game's Plugins directory.
